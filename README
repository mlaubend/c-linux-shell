SUMMARY:
This is a simple shell in c that executes linux commands.  Each user inputted command is parsed through an inlined parser, concatenated with "/usr/bin/",  A child process is then forked, exec() is called and the command executed.

extra functionality includes: 
redirects
cmd > file - redirects the standard output of cmd to a file
cmd 1> file - same as cmd > file
cmd 2> file - redirects the standard error of cmd to a file
cmd >> file - append stdout of cmd to a file
cmd 2>> file - append stderr of cmd to a file
cmd &> file - redirect stdout and stderr of cmd to a file
cmd < file redirect the contents of the file to the stdin of cmd  

extra functions include: a 'cd' function to navigate through files and directories, and a 'trimwhitespace' function to help the parser.
